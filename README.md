# Fitting-and-Visualizing-of-a-Regression-model
## The final project for the course CS-C2105 Programming Studio A at Aalto University

- The projectâ€™s goal is to build a program which can be used to fit a regression model to a dataset and visualize the result, as well as assessing the model with mean squared error.
- It supports two regression model: linear and quadratic regression. 
- Users can modify the plot by changing the lines' and data points' color.
